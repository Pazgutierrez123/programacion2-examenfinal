        severity="Warning"
        message="Not targeting the latest versions of Android; compatibility modes apply. Consider testing and updating this version. Consult the `android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES` javadoc for details."
        category="Correctness"
        priority="6"
        summary="Target SDK attribute is not targeting latest version"
        explanation="When your application runs on a version of Android that is more recent than your `targetSdkVersion` specifies that it has been tested with, various compatibility modes kick in. This ensures that your application continues to work, but it may look out of place. For example, if the `targetSdkVersion` is less than 14, your app may get an option button in the UI.&#xA;&#xA;To fix this issue, set the `targetSdkVersion` to the highest available value. Then test your app to make sure everything works correctly. You may want to consult the compatibility notes to see what changes apply to each version you are adding support for: https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build.VERSION_CODES.html as well as follow this guide:&#xA;https://developer.android.com/distribute/best-practices/develop/target-sdk.html"

        explanation="FragmentContainerView replaces the &lt;fragment> tag as the preferred                 way of adding fragments via XML. Unlike the &lt;fragment> tag, FragmentContainerView                 uses a normal `FragmentTransaction` under the hood to add the initial fragment,                 allowing further FragmentTransaction operations on the FragmentContainerView                 and providing a consistent timing for lifecycle events."

In the past there have been subtle bugs (such as themes not getting applied correctly) when the `&lt;application>` tag appears before some of these other elements, so it&apos;s best to order your manifest in the logical dependency order."

        summary="Image without `contentDescription`"
        explanation="Non-textual widgets like ImageViews and ImageButtons should use the `contentDescription` attribute to specify a textual description of the widget such that screen readers and other accessibility tools can adequately describe the user interface.&#xA;&#xA;Note that elements in application screens that are purely decorative and do not provide any content or enable a user action should not have accessibility content descriptions. In this case, set their descriptions to `@null`. If your app&apos;s minSdkVersion is 16 or higher, you can instead set these graphical elements&apos; `android:importantForAccessibility` attributes to `no`.&#xA;&#xA;Note that for text fields, you should not set both the `hint` and the `contentDescription` attributes since the hint will never be shown. Just set the `hint`."
